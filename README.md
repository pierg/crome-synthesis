# crome-synthesis

LTL Reactive Synthesis package using [strix](https://strix.model.in.tum.de).

### System Requirements

[Strix](https://strix.model.in.tum.de) must be installed on the system. Alternatively, a
[docker](https://www.docker.com) must be installed and running.

## Dependencies

Clone crome-logic from git in the same folder where crome-web is located

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pierg/crome-logic.git
```

Append it to PYTHONPATH

```bash
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:../crome-logic/
```

## Installation

We use
[conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) to
manage the environment and dependencies.

We use [poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry) to manage 'development'
dependencies (e.g. linting, type checking).

You need to install `conda-merge` so that we can merge all the dependecies from the
other repositories and create the `environment.yml`

```bash
pip install conda-merge
```

Once `conda-merge` is installed, you can create the `envioronment.yml` file, create the
environment and activate it by runnin the following commands:

```bash
make conda-create
make conda-install
make conda-activate
```

Install the other dependencies with poetry (optional):

```bash
poetry install
```

## Docker

You can directly run the project by running the docker image on any platform

`docker run -it --platform linux/x86_64 pmallozzi/crome-synthesis:latest`

### Building the image

To build the image you can run the following command

`docker buildx build --platform linux/x86_64 -t [DOCKERUSERNAME]/[PROJECT]:[TAG] --push .`

## Usage

Check the `examples` folder

## One magic command

Run `make lint` to run all the typing, linting and formatting tools

Run `make pre-commit` to run all the pre-commit tools

Check all the available commands in `Makefile`
